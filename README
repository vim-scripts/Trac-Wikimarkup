Syntax highlighting for Trac WikiMarkup.  

I was a little unsatisfied with the other available wikimarkup highlighters available-- they were either too focused on a specific wiki engine to be useful for Trac, or its highlighting was less-than-complete.

In an effort to address this issue, I decided to make a few updates and modifications to http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=725.
